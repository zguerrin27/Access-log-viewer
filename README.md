# README

This application allows a user to read and search through Apache Server Access-logs.  
  
It uses React.js for the front end, Ruby on Rails for the API and postgresQL for the DB. 

The search feature allows a user to search by 11 parameters, ( each column of the Access-Log ), along with modifiers such as "starts with", "contains", "ends with" etc.  

Important Information:  
Instead of Create-React-App, I used webpacker to serve
