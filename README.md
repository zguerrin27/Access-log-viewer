# README

This application allows a user to read and search through Apache Server Access-logs.  
  
It uses React.js for the front end, Ruby on Rails for the API and postgresQL for the DB. 

The search feature allows a user to search by 11 parameters, ( each column of the Access-Log ), along with modifiers such as "starts with", "contains", "ends with" etc.  

Important Information:  

Instead of Create-React-App, I use Webpack to compile Javascript, CSS, and React components. In app/views/requests/index.html.erb you will see <%= javascript_pack_tag 'index' %> which injects the react code into my rails app.  
    
In app/javascript/components you will find the components I created.  
In app/controllers/requests_controller.rb you will find my API.  
In app/models/request.rb you will find my Request model, along with some validation and the scopes I used for my API.       
In app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss you will find some styling I wrote to compliment the Bootstrap and ANT designs styling that I used.    
In app/db/seeds.rb you can see how I broke down the txt file I was given and built the information to insert into my DB.    
In app/test/Components you can see all of my tests for my React components/validation tests.    
In app/test/controllers/requests_controller_test.rb you can see all of my tests for my API.  
In app/test/models/request_test.rb you can see my model tests.
